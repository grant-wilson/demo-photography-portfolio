- unfortunately the openwc template has issues... and I'm unsure about the health of that repo which sucks.
- so i'll have to create my own template and mirror it off of material-web
- maybe
  - npm workspace
  - components
  - web-static
  - web-angular*
  - web-react*
  - use wireit
  - prettier & eslint*
  - scss pattern like material-web
  - start script
  - build script
  - deploy script
